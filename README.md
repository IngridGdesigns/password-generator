# Password Generator

A solo project to work further with the DOM and javascript and CSS flexbox. Generated passwords using Math.random() -- (not best practice, this is just an exercise!!). Please be aware that Math.random() does not provide cryptographically secure random numbers. Please visit [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random) to read up on Math.random().
